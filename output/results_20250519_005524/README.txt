Loop Closure Detection Results
============================

This directory contains the key results of the loop closure detection system:

1. trajectory_3d.png - 3D visualization of the vehicle trajectory with detected loop closures
2. loop_closure_*.jpg - Example images showing feature matches between frames

The system successfully detected multiple loop closures in the dataset, demonstrating its ability to recognize when the vehicle returns to previously visited locations.
